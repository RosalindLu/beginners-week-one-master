  <p1>I'm currently learning to code with
    <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/" title="CFG">Code First Girls</a>
    Going over everything from how the internet works, to creating
    websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in 8 weeks!
    Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why</p1>
    <ol>
      <li>You can understand what is going on 'under the hood'</li>
      <li>Not have to someone else for a quick prototype website</li>
      <li>It's fun!</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><strong>What do you need to create a website</strong></h2>
    <p2>Not much!</p2>
    <ul>
      <li>A computer (always a good start)</li>
      <li>A text editor (I am using atom)</li>
      <li>A web browser (A am using chrome)</li>
      <li>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</li>
    </ul>
    <p3>Follow my progress on <a href="https://github.com/">Git</a></p3>
